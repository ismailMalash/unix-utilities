# unix-utilities
This repository contains implementations of basic Unix utilities in C, as part of my learning and practice of system programming. The utilities implemented include pwd, echo, cp, and mv, each demonstrating key concepts of system-level programming, such as working with system calls, file I/O operations, and error handling.
